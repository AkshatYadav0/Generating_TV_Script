# Generating_TV_Script
RNN Model which generates TV Scripts ( which doesn't always makes sense....)

The model uses 3 LSTM Layers 1 embedded layer 1 Fully connected layer

This is just a basic model the generated script is not perfect and doesn't always makes sense....

Open the jupyter notebook and read you'll be good to go
